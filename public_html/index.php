				<p>About me:</p>
				<p>At eighteen, I set off towards Nepal with the intention of volunteering in a women’s shelter for a
				few months before going to college. On the way there, I stopped in Thailand, went to an island
				and took a scuba diving course, got caught in a typhoon, and missed my flight to Nepal. I never
				went on to Nepal, never went back to college, and ended up living in Thailand for the next eighteen
				years. During that time, I found I could pursue my interests for the sheer joy of learning and
				adventure. I realized that my hard work and perseverance could bring me success. I pushed through
				the self-doubt that comes from following the unbeaten path, and managed to teach myself to
				speak Thai, start several businesses, provide services to clients from all over the world, and learned
				how to flourish in a different culture. When my daughter was thirteen, I took what might have
				been my hardest challenge, which was to return to the US, to ensure she could pursue her education.
				Since my return, I have worked for a small non-profit, degree-granting college supporting the
				apprenticeship model of midwifery education. I have continuously sought to improve my skills and
				capabilities, and have been able to rise to the position of Chief Operations Officer. During my
				time there, I was able to look at the outcome we were seeking, and implement structural systems
				changes that have allowed this school to increase student matriculation from less than 20 to over
				160, while keeping expenses and staffing needs low. I realized we needed a new website and
				database, so learned how to make these, and then made them for the College. I am overjoyed to
				be able to step away from the College and move forward in my education to learn full-stack
				coding and digital development - an area which has called to me since Thailand, when I was designing t-
					shirts and brochures for my businesses. The adventure has just begun!</p>
